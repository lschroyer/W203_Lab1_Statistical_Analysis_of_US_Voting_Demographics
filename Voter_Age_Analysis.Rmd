# Are Democratic voters older or younger than Republican voters in 2020?

## Importance and Context

Are Democratic voters older or younger than Republican voters in 2020?

The age profile of the electorate is always one of the most important factors in forecasting and understanding American politics and election outcomes. People in different generations tend to gravitate to different political ideologies. In particular, it is generally believed that conservative values resonate more with older Americans, making them more likely to vote Republican. But is this stereotype true? We analyzed 2020 pre-election data to test whether there is an age difference between Democratic voters and Republic voters. If it can be shown that the ages of Democratic electorates and Republicans are not equal, there may be policy implications to consider as a result of which party is in power, as different administrations will prioritize initiatives that cater to their constituents. 

This is especially crucial since the turnout rate for the older people is much higher. For example, in 2018 midterm elections, the turnout rate of people age 65 and above is 64%. In contrast, only 44% of people age 35-45 and 30% of people age 18-24 cast a ballot. 

## Description of Data

We used the pre-election data from the 2020 American National Election Studies (ANES) site to address this question. The following variables are extracted for further processing and exploration this topic:

registered_to_vote_status(V201008), voted_early_in_gen_election(V201022), plan_to_vote_in_gen_election(V201032),party_of_registration_str(V201018), democrat_party_rating(V201156), republican_party_rating(V201157),age(V201507x)

For the purposes of this study, we defined "voters" as survey respondents who: 1) registered to vote (V201008) and either 2) voted early in general election(V201022) or 3) planned to vote(V201032). We then looked into the registered party of the voters. If there is registered party information(V201018), we assigned it as party affiliation for the respondent.

However, we noticed that 48% of the survey respondents do not have applicable registered party information. Because this represents such a large portion of the sample, we decided to analyze other variables to determine whether there was a way to infer political party affiliation. To that end, we measured the respondents' difference in party rating(V201156,V201157), using "feeling thermometer" variables which ranged from 0-100. If one party was rated 50+ points higher than the other party (measured as seen below in the chart for democratic voters), we assigned that party to that respondent. To illustrate this party assignment methodology, Figure 1 shows the preference of Democratic party over Republican. The right tail with values greater than 50 represents all the respondents we assigned as Democratic voters. Respondents on the left tail with values below -50 were assigned as Republican voters.

```

This party assignment methodology assigned party information to 2105 data points out of the 3929 respondents that did not have applicable registered party information, bringing the total sample size of eligible voters with clear party tendency to 7624. This larger sample will substantially increase the power of our statistical test.

Next, we examined the age of the voters. The age(V201507x) is by year except for all the people above 80 who are bucketed into an "80+" bin. In addition, respondents who refused to answer the age question were assigned as -9. Figure 2 shows there are more Democratic voters in all the age buckets below 50 and more Republican voters in age buckets above 50, including the "80+" bin, as well as the "refuse to answer" bucket. Since there is little information available to impute the age of the "refuse to answer" group, we excluded them from our analysis and statistical tests. For the samples in "80+" bin, we assume an age of 80 for the purpose of our analysis. We discuss this further in the "test limitations" section of this report. Table 1 (above) shows  the mean and median ages of Democratic voters vs. Republican voters and the trimmed mean calculated without the "80+" bin. In both scenarios, the mean and median of the Democratic voters are less than the Republican voters. However, is this age difference statistically and practically significant?

## Most appropriate test

To determine whether there is a statistical difference in the ages of Democratic voters and Republican voters, we compared the mean of the age of two groups using the Unpaired Welch-t Two Sample Test. The reasons we selected this test are as follows:

(1) The two sample groups consists sample data points unrelated to each other.

(2) The data is interval except the 80+ bin. For the 80+ bin, as in the mean/median calculation, we just assumed it is 80 for testing. It is a simplified treatment of the data. However, the possible impacts are discussed in the test limitation section.

(3) The data extracted from the population is I.I.D. Given the nature of the methodology of collecting these survey responses, it is possible that respondents tell friends and other family members about the survey (as there is a paid incentive to participate), resulting in clusters of similar responses. However, it is difficult to ascertain or quantify this phenomenon, and our expectation is that this clustering effect is minimal.

(4) The sample size is very large. The sample sizes of Democratic voters and Republic voters are 2701 and 2260 respectively. Although the samples are not perfectly normally distributed, the large sample size should outweigh the skewness, as the sampling distribution of the sample means is expected to be approximately normal under the Central Limit Theorem.

(5) The sample variance actually is unknown due to the 80+ bin. Under such circumstances, the Welch-t test is generally regarded as a more appropriate t test.

Therefore, we decided to use the Welch-t Two Sample Test. The Null Hypothesis for the test is that the means of the age of two voter groups are equal. We used a two-tailed test in this study because we didn't want to assume one group is older or younger than the other group beforehand.

In addition to the statistical difference, we also would like to examine whether the difference is practically significant enough for us to act on. Therefore, we also calculated the effect size to reach a final conclusion.

## Test results and interpretation

The t-test results indicated that the Null Hypothesis was rejected at 95% confidence level. The reported p-value was `r round(t.test(h1$age,h2$age)$p.value,2)` , nearly zero. So statistically, we can conclude the mean age of two groups are different. With a t-value of `r round(t.test(h1$age,h2$age)$statistic,2)` , we measured that the mean of Democratic voters is smaller than Republican voters. This also seems to be consistent with our earlier observations that Democratic voters are younger.

However, using Cohen's d, the effect size of the test is `r round(effectSize[4],2)`. This means the practical significance of the age difference is fairly small, almost negligible. To summarize, we can say that Democratic voters as a group are younger than Republican voters, but the age difference is of little to no practical significance. Tying back to our motivation for answering this question as stated in the introduction, if certain political policies are related to the ages of the constituents of the party in power, our results suggest we probably would not see any policy changes made as a result of age differences alone.


## Test limitation

In our analysis, we assume the age "80+" bin as 80 years old since there is no way for us to know the exact distribution of data in this bin. However, this bin constitutes 5.04% of the Democratic voters' group and 5.81% of Republic voters' group. Different age distributions within this bin could theoretically alter our conclusions from this study, but we do not have a strong reason to suspect a substantial difference in age distributions between Democratic and Republican voters in this 80+ bin.
