class website: https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/203

The course covers focuses on measurement, inferential statistics and causal inference using the open-source statistics language, R. Topics in quantitative techniques include: descriptive and inferential statistics, sampling, experimental design, tests of difference, ordinary least squares regression, general linear models.

In this project, my team used statistical methods to analyze trends in US voting demographics during the 2020 US presidential election and answer the following questions:

1. Are Democratic voters older or younger than Republican voters in 2020?
2. Are Democratic voters more enthusiastic about Joe Biden or Kamala Harris?
3. Are survey respondents who have had someone in their home infected by COVID-19 more likely to disapprove of the way their governor is handling the pandemic?
